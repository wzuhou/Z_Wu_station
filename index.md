## About me
Research fellow at the Roslin institute, University of Edinburgh, UK. My postdoctoral project is about the genomics of sparrow and the RNA-seq analysis on seasonality.
I did my PhD in Wageningen University& Research, the Netherlands (2016-2021). My PhD project in WUR focused on functional genomics in chicken, including the genotype-phenotype mapping of dwarfism, population genetics of human-mediated introgression, comparative genomics, and transcriptomics.

**Research experience**ï¼š Whole-genome sequence data, RNA-seq data,and genome editing techniques (CRISPR-Cas9).

**My passion and interest** are growing in bioinformatics to develop bioinformatic tools, understanding the function of the genome, and using genomics to study the demographic history of domesticated populations. 

I am a person full of curiosity, which makes me enthusiastic about new knowledge. :metal:

Key words: genomics, genetics, bioinformatics, and chicken
