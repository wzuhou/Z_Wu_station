## About me
My PhD project in WUR focuses on functional genomics in chicken, including the genotype-phenotype mapping, population genetics of human-mediated introgression, comparative genomics, and transcriptomics.

**Research experience** ï¼šWhole-genome sequence data, RNA-seq data,and genome editing techniques (CRISPR-Cas9).

**My passion and interest** are growing in bioinformatics to develop computational tools, understanding the function of the genome, and using genomics to study the demographic history of domesticated populations. 

I am a person full of curiosity, which makes me enthusiastic about new knowledge. :metal:

### Key words: genomics, genetics, bioinformatics, and chicken
